java coding practises:

+ why is it necessary?
-> developing high quality software
-> SonarQube can be used

+ uses:
-> maintainability
-> debugging
-> scalability
-> easier to collaborate
-> easier to document
-> efficient
-> easier to read

+ methods to write clean java code:
-> use a standard project structure
-> have a proper naming convention
-> should be readable and understandable
-> use meaningful commenst and documentation
-> proper whitespaces and indentation (formatting)
-> keep it simple
-> try to reduct repetitive code
-> logging
